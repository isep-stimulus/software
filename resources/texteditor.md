# Text editors 

You probably now what a text editor is. It's a tool to write code. You'lle use one like you use Microsoft Word to write texts. 

# Difference between text editors and IDEs
The term “IDE” comes from Integrated Development Environment. It is intended as a set of tools that all work together: text editor, compiler, build or make integration, debugging, etc. A text editor can only be used to write code. There is no integrated compiler and debugger but you can install extensions to add great features so the power of text editors is limitless. If you prefer using an IDE, you can.
